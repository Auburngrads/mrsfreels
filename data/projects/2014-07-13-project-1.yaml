 Here's where I'll post videos of me (and my family) reading some of your favorite books. I'll also post other links to places you can go to hear more books being read aloud. 
 
 I'll update this page a few times each week -- so check back often!

#    description: The DRUDGE REPORT is a U.S. based news aggregation website run by Matt Drudge .[5] Founded by Matt Drudge and run with the help of Charles Hurt[2] and Daniel Halper,[6] the site is generally regarded as a conservative publication. Its ownership and political leanings are currently in question, especially following business model changes in mid-late 2019.[7][8][9][10] The site consists mainly of links to news stories from other outlets about politics, entertainment, and current events; it also has links to many columnists. Occasionally, Drudge authors news stories himself, based on tips.
