 Here's where I'll post videos of me reading some of your favorite books. I'll also post other places you can go to hear more books read aloud. 
 
 I'll update this page a few times each week -- so check back often!

    description: The DRUDGE REPORT is a U.S. based news aggregation website run by Matt Drudge .[5] Founded by Matt Drudge and run with the help of Charles Hurt[2] and Daniel Halper,[6] the site is generally regarded as a conservative publication. Its ownership and political leanings are currently in question, especially following business model changes in mid-late 2019.[7][8][9][10] The site consists mainly of links to news stories from other outlets about politics, entertainment, and current events; it also has links to many columnists. Occasionally, Drudge authors news stories himself, based on tips.
